excerpt     :
  Check it out,  
  yeah y'all,  
  here we go again

Bass! How low can you go?  
Death row, what a brother knows  
Once again, back is the incredible

Check it out, yeah y'all, here we go again  
They call themselves black, but we'll see if they'll play this  
Time for me to exit, Terminator X-it  
Yeah, I'm telling you

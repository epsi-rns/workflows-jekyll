Look in my face, stare in my soul

{% include shortcodes/advert.html img="oto-spies-01.png" %}

Why, do you like playing around with  
My, narrow scope of reality  
I, can feel it all start slipping  
I think I'm breaking down

{% include shortcodes/advert.html img="oto-spies-02.png" %}

Look in my face, stare into my soul  
I begin to stupify
